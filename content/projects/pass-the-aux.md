client: Course Project
description: Many of us have had the responsibility of playing music at a party, sometimes
  the music you choose is not a hit with anyone and just the act of choosing is sapping
  all of your time. Pass the Aux is an application that allows guests at a party to
  select the music that they want to hear and allows the host to have a better time
  at their own party.

    I'm a software engineer based in Troy, NY who has a strong passion for all things tech. Over the last 7 years, I have had experience working on a large variety of projects of varying sizes including software applications, mobile apps, websites, and even some video games. I am always excited when presented with opportunities to add new technologies to my toolbelt and am never afraid of a challenge.

    I currently work as a Developer at [Troy Web Consulting](https://troyweb.com "Troy Web Consulting").
